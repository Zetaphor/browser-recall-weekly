# Code Commenting Best Practices

- Only add comments when it's not obvious what the code is doing.
- Comments should explain why something is happening, not what is happening, the code should explain that.
- Don't wrap functions in a comment block.
- Use docstrings where applicable.
- Don't add comments describing the changes you just made.

# Code Addition Best Practices

- Don't include extra code that was not requested, don't provide optional or alternative implemnentations. Choose one implementation only and use that.
- Don't include commented out code. If I need something I will ask for it.
